# vnn-comp: Verification of Neural Networks Competition
(https://sites.google.com/view/vnn20/vnncomp)

# Categories
## CNN: convolutional neural networks
## PWL: feedforward networks with piecewise linear activations (e.g., ReLU)
## NLN: feedforward neural networks with nonlinear activations (e.g., tanh, sigmoid)

# Benchmarks
Benchmarks are organized into the categories and subfolders based on the benchmark name. For 2020, most benchmarks are image classifiers (primarily MNIST, some CIFAR), with the exception of ACAS-Xu networks in the PWL category that have input-output relationships defined.

# Results Submission
Please fork the repository and create a pull request, some further details on the VNN-COMP webpage linked above, and further instructions to be provided for where to put relevant files (Dockerfile, batch execution script(s)).
